### Project Report: Healthcare Dashboard

# Introduction
This project involves developing a healthcare dashboard with React and Python. The React-based implementation creates a responsive and modern web interface, while Python (Tkinter) is used to demonstrate a lightweight desktop GUI alternative. Both implementations aim to provide an intuitive user experience for entering and submitting user data.

# Objective
To create an efficient and visually appealing healthcare dashboard using two frontend approaches: a web-based solution with React and a desktop-based solution with Python (Tkinter).

## Development Process:
# 1.	Understanding Requirements

# - Input Fields:
  - Name (text input)
  - Age (dropdown menu with values from 1–100)
  - File Upload (PDF format)
# - Submit Button:
  - Collects and validates user input.

# - Additional Features:
  - Clean and minimalistic UI design.
  - Responsive web layout for React.
  - Structured desktop GUI for Tkinter.


## 2.	Web-Based Frontend Development (React)

## Step 1: Setting Up React Environment
# 1. Initialize React App:
   - Command: `npx create-react-app healthcare-dashboard`
   - A structured environment was created for scalable development.
# 2. Install Dependencies:
   - Installed `styled-components` for modular styling.
   - Used `react-icons` for visual enhancements.

# Step 2: Designing the Layout
# - UI/UX Design Principles:
  - Adopted a healthcare-friendly color palette (e.g., soothing blues and whites).
  - Integrated a card-based layout for structured information input.
# - Components:
  - Header: Displays the title and branding.
  - Form: Houses input fields for user data entry.
  - Popup: Provides feedback for successful or incomplete submissions.

# Step 3: Implementing Functionalities
# - Input Fields:
  - Name input using `<input type="text">`.
  - Dropdown menu for age, dynamically generated with values 1–100.
  - File upload using `<input type="file">` with a custom label.
# - Form Validation:
  - Ensured mandatory fields (name, age, file) are completed before submission.
  - Highlighted missing or incorrect fields dynamically.

# Step 4: Responsive Design
- Utilized CSS grid and flexbox for adaptive layouts.
- Added media queries to ensure the dashboard works on various screen sizes.

# Step 5: Testing
- Verified field functionality and responsiveness across devices.
- Checked proper file upload handling and notification animations.


## 3.	Desktop-Based Frontend Development (Python with Tkinter)

# Step 1: Setting Up Tkinter
# 1. Environment:
   - Tkinter is a built-in Python library, making it lightweight and accessible.
   - No additional installations were required.
# 2. Core Components:
   - `Entry` widget for text input (name).
   - `OptionMenu` for age dropdown selection.
   - File upload handled using `askopenfile`.

# Step 2: Designing the Layout
# - UI Principles:
  - Organized widgets for logical grouping and alignment.
  - Applied padding for visual clarity.
# -Implementation:
  - Used the `grid` layout manager for structured positioning.
  - Created labels for instructions alongside inputs.

# Step 3: Functionalities
# - Input Fields:
  - `Entry` widget for text input.
  - Dropdown menu populated with values 1–100 using `OptionMenu`.
  - File upload triggered by a button, opening a file dialog for PDF selection.
# - Form Validation:
  - Checked if all fields were filled before submission.
  - Displayed error messages for incomplete fields.
  
# Step 4: Testing
- Verified that all widgets behaved as expected across various resolutions.
- Tested file selection and ensured it restricted to `.pdf` files.

## Challenges Faced
# 1. Responsive Design in Tkinter:
   - Solution: Used `grid` manager with weight configurations for resizing.
# 2. Dropdown Population:
   - Solution: Dynamically generated values for the age dropdown in both React and Tkinter.
# 3. File Upload Restrictions:
   - Solution: Implemented logic to ensure only `.pdf` files could be selected.

## Technologies Used
# 1. React:
   - Core framework for web-based UI.
   - Styled-Components for modular styling.
   - React Icons for intuitive iconography.
# 2. Python (Tkinter):
   - Lightweight GUI toolkit for desktop applications.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a healthcare dashboard using two different frontend approaches. The React implementation provides a responsive, modern web application, while the Tkinter implementation showcases a compact desktop alternative. Both designs emphasize user-friendly interfaces and functionality tailored to the healthcare domain.
